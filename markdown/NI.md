# Chapter 1 - Overview

## Transmission Media & Network Cables

- Twisted Pair
- Optical Fibre
- Coaxial Cable

## OSI 7 Layers

1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer

## Structured Cabling

Installation of cables in building / campus in structured manner

- **Demarcation Point**
  - Point where telecom prover network ends and connects with on-premise wiring at customer premise
- **Equipment Room**
  - Large Telecom room that may hourse servers, routers, switch, etc.
- **Telecommunications Room**
  - House Equipment and wiring consolidation points that serve users inside building
- **Backbone / Vertical / Riser Wiring**
  - Connects between telecommunication rooms, as rooms are nomally on different floors
- **Horizontal Wiring**
  - Connects telecommunications rooms (may use wiring closets) to individual outlets / work areas, through wireways / conduits / ceiling spaces
- **Work Area Components**
  - Connect end-user equipment to outlets of horizontal cabling systems

### Demarcation Point

- Point which outdoor cabling interfaces with intrabuilding backbone cabling
- Boundary between service provider and responsibility of customer

### Equipment Room (ER)

- After cable enters through Demarcation point, it travels to equipment room (ER)
- Centre of voice and data network
- Effectively a large Telco room that may house servers, routers, switches, etc.
- Equipment room is different from Telco room as ER is building / campus serving vs floor serving

### Telecommunications Room (TR)

- ER feeds to one or more TRs
- TRs are where backbone cabling transitions to horizontal cabling

### Backbone / Vertical Cabling

- Any cabling between ER and another TR throughout the facility
  - Includes TRs on same floor
  - Vertical Connection(risers) between TRs on different floors
  - Inter-buildings cabling in a multibuilding campus
- Usually Fibre Optic cables

### Distribution / Horizontal Cabling

- Distributes cables from TR to work areas
  - Usually UTP cables
  - Protects against pairs that might fail during installation

### Work Area

- Area serviced by individual TR
- usually occupies 1 floor / part of 1 floor of building

#### Servicing Work Area

- Uniform wiring plan must be used through patch panel system

# Chapter 2 -  Ethernet Switching

## Hubs

- Operates at Layer 1
- Only 1 PC can transmit at a time
- Physical star logical bus topoligies
- Collison possible in the hub

## Switches

- Operate at Layer 2 (including Layer 1)
- More than 1 PC can transmit at the same time
- Dedicated paths between pairs of communicating PCs
- No collision in the switch

## Domains

### Collision Domain

- Collision occur when 2 or more ethernet hosts transmit simultaneously
- Logical area in network where data packets can collide with one another
- range in size from single segment of cable to entire network
- Layer 1 devices, such as repeaters and hubs do not break up collision domains as these devices automatically forward all data sent on cable / other media
- Layer 2 and 3 devices, such as bridges, switches, routers break up collision domains

### Broadcast Domain

- area of network composed of all computers and networking devices that can be reached by sending frame to broadcast address
- Ethernet LANs are broadcast domain - any device connected to LAN can transmit frame to any other device

## Ethernet Switching

- Break large collision domains into parts using switch
  - reduces collisions and increases reliability
- Switching - technologies that decrease congestion in LAN by reducing traffic and increasing bandwidth
- LAN switches - Operating at Layer 2, forward frames based on MAC address

## Switching Operations

### Address Learning

- Reads source MAC address of each data frame that is transmitted and noting the port where the frame enters the switch
  - Eg. Port 1 -> MAC address AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA, Port 2 -> MAC address BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB, etc
- Stored in MAC Address Table
- Learnt Dynamically

### Flooding

- Sends out on all ports(except the port that frame entered from), when destination address is broadcast / unknown address

### Forwarding

- Forwards when destination is known
- Forwards frame to appropriate segment

### Filter

- Filter happens when destination is located on same interface
- Blocks frame from going on to other segments

## Switching Modes

### Store-and-Forward Switching

- Reads entire / complete frame into memory buffer & determine whether frame is valid / invalid
- Determine whether port is available before it switches the valid frames to outgoing destination port / segment
  - Frames are corrupted by checking CFC code field
- Advantage
  - Prevent wasting of bandwidth on destination by invalid / bad frames that can adversly affect network performance
- Disadvantage
  - Increases latency / delay due to frame integrity checking and memory buffering

### Cut Through Switching

- Fast forward switching / On the fly switching
- Reads beginning of frame up to destination MAC address field in frams as traffic flows through switch
- Does not wait for entire data frame to be read in before switching frame to destination port - **Cut Through**
- Advantage
  - Fast and minimum latency between ports
  - Requires less memory
- Disadvantage
  - Lacks error detection / frame error checking
  - Forwards corrupted and truncated frames & could congest network traffic with unwanted invalid frames

### Fragment-Free Switching

- Frames are buffered until first 64 bytes have been received
- Can check for any bad frames due to collision but will not be able to check for bad frames due to CRC errors
- Results in lesser latency as frame is sent after it has read 64 bytes
- Faster switching speeds
- Advantage
  - No frames less than 64 bytes forwarded
  - Disadvantage - Errors can be forwarded

## Redundancy

- Multiple switches and trunk links
- If one device fails, another one takes over

### Problems

- Switching loops give problems if all links are active
  - Broadcast storms
    - Flood broadcast through non source ports
  - Multiple frams transmission
    - Since A doesn't know where B is, flood, causing broadcast storm
  - Inconsistent switch tables
    - End device apprears to be on multiple ports

### Solution

- 1 path ata time
- Redundant parths must be shutdown, but ready to be opened when needed
- Done quickly and automatically
- **Spanning Tree Protocol(STP)** Does this

## Spanning Tree Protocol

### Rules

- Tree topology
  - Has no loops
- All devices are connected

### Switches

- Used by switches to turn redundant topology to spanning tree
- Disables unwanted links by blocking ports
- Switch runs STP by default - no config needed

### Algorithm

1. Select 1 switch to be **root bridge**
  - Bridge ID (BID) of priority value followed by MAC address
  - Switches exchange Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU) to compare bridge IDs
  - Switch with lowest bridge ID becomes root bridge
  - Admins can set priority to fix selection
2. Select a **root port** on each switch
  - Every non-root switch selects a root port
  - Port with shortest distance / lowest cost path to root bridge
  - If same distance, use lowest ID
3. Select a **designated port** on each segment
  - Port with lowest cost path to root bridge becomes designated port
  - If same cost, use lowest ID
4. Close down all other redundant ports
  - Any port not a root port / designated port is put in blocking state

## Ethernet

Too lazy to fill this up

# Chapter 3 - Static Routing Protocols

## Router

- Router is internetworking device that connects 2 or more networks
- Performs forwarding / filtering of data at network layer
- decisions based on destination IP address
- routes from one network to another until it reaches its destination

### Benefits

- Seperate network logically into subnets making it more manageable
- Control trafic flow between different networks
- Firewall for broadcast traffic
- interface between LAN(Ethernet) and WAN(PPP) protocols

## Static Routing

- entries in the routing table of router that are manually set to user defined specific paths
- Administrator must know entire network and manually configure all routes if all are static
- Useful in Stub Network(network that is accessible by only 1 path)

### Advantage

- Enhance Secutiry
  - Administrator might want to hide parts of intranetwork and specify only parts that need to be revealed
  - Static route forces traffic to take specific, secure route instead of route determined dynamically which can change as network topology changes, making traffic travel over insecure route
- Does not consume as much traffic - no routing updates are transmitted

### Disadvantage

- Not suitable for large networks - administrator must know **entire** network and **manually configure** all routes if all routers are static
- Any change to network means reconfiguring all routers to reflect change
- not able to reroute traffic if link fails

## Static route Operation

1. Network admin configures route in router
2. Router installs route in routing table
3. Packets are forwarded based on static route entries in routing table

## Defining Static Route

- Specify **Next Hop** address for packet
  - Next hop address is the address of the next router to transmit data to
  - Syntax - `ip route destination-network subnet-mask gateway`
    - `ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.2.1` - Transmit all data going to 172.16.1.0 to 172.16.2.1
    - `ip route 172.16.5.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.2.1` - transmit all data going to 172.16.5.0 to 172.16.2.1
- Default Route
  - Special staitc route that follows format `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 next-hop-address`
  - Route packets with destinations that do not match other toutes
  - Routers are typically configured with default route for internet-bound traffic - impractical and unnecessary to maintain routes to all networks in internet

## Commands

- `show ip route`
  - shows ip routes present in routing table
- `traceroute <ip>`
  - displays route taken by packet and measuring transit delay of packets

# Chapter 4 - Dynamic Routing Protocols

- Minimum configuration and set-up required
- Routes are automatically discovered and maintained by routers through exchange of information
- Routing decisions made based on dynamically learned routes

## Protocols

- Distance Vector
  - Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
- Link State
  - Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

## Distance Vector Protocol

- Each router informs its neighbours of its entire routing table periodically
- Routing information sent consists of destinations, costs, and next hop to get there
- Will select neighbour advertising lowest cost / lowest hops
- E.g. Router A learns that router B can get to D in 2 hops, A can assume that path from A to D is 3 hops
- When all routers have full view of network, the network is said to have "converged"

### Advantage

- Consumes little memory and CPU

### Disadvantage

- Reacts slowly to any topology changes

### Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

- Uses hop count as routing metric to determine shortest route to destination
- Does not take *speed, delay and reliability* into consideration
- Max no of hops is 15
  - Route with hop count of 16 is considered unreachable
- Updates routing table to neighbours every 30s. **A lot** of overhead traffic

### RIP commands

- `show ip protocols`
  - shows information about routing protocols and networks it is being used for
- `router rip`
  - goes to RIP config mode and sets RIP as routing protocol
- `network <network-address>`
  - enables RIP for the given network

## Link State Protocol

- First discover who neighbouring routers are and will exchange packets called Link State Packets (LSP)
- LSP contains info about networks the router is directly connected to
- Require routers to only send updates to other routers when there are changes

### Advantage

- Easier to debug and less bandwith-intensive than distance-vectors
- Faster convergence time (react quickly to topology changes

### Disadvantage

- more CPU and memory resources required

### Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

- uses cost to calculate optimal route
  - cost is dependent on speed, reliability, delay
    - Speed - speed of each link
    - Delay - Time required to move packet from source to destination
    - Reliability - Dependability of each network link

# Chapter 5 - Network Troubleshooting Techniques

## ipconfig

- Used to display info about computers addressing and connectivity params

## ping

- Tests whether another host on TCP/IP network is reachable.
- Round trip times are reported

## Tracert

- Facilitates user to know route IP packet travelled from one router to another
- Measures round trip time

## nslookup

- **N**ame **S**erver Lookup
- Tool for querying DNS
  - Obtain Domain anme
  - IP address mapping
  - Any DNS record

## netstat

- Displays network connectinos, routing tables, network interface stats

## telnet

- Application layer protocol used to access remote computers
- Unencrypted

## ssh

- Secure Shell is network protocol to allow remote login and other network services
- Secure over unsecured network
- Replacement for telnet

## route print

- Interface list
- IPv4 route table
- IPv4 persistent routes
- IPv6 route table
- IPv6 persistent routes

# Chapter 6 - IP Subnetting

## IP Address

- ICANN issues all IP addresses
  - Private and non government organisation

## Mechanisms to overcome limitations in IP address space

- Subnet Addressing
- Classless addressing - CIDR

## Classes

### Class A

- First bit 0
- Next 7 bits are network ID
- Last 24 bits are host ID

### Class B

- First 2 bits 10
- Next 14 bits are network ID
- Last 16 bits are host ID

### Class C

- First 3 bits are 110
- Next 21 bits are network ID
- Last 8 bits are host ID

### Class D

- First 4 bits are 1110
- Next 28 bitsa are multicast group ID

### Class E

- First 5 bits are 11110

## Addressing Rules

- host portion of IP addresss cannot be all 1 bits (broadcast addresss) or 0 bits (network ID)
- Class A network no 127 is assigned to loopback function
- certain addresss ranges are private / reserved

## Public and Private Addresses

- Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) manages supply fo IP addresses
- Ensures no duplication

- All public IP addresses must be obtained from ISP or registry at some expense
- Private IP address are used within networks that are not connected to internet
  - Class A 10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255
  - Class B 172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255
  - Class C 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

## Subnetting

  - Better manageability
  - Better Security
  - Interconnects LANs to form a WAN
  - Reduce size of broadcast (collision) domain

  - Based on structure, network admin needs to decide
    - Number of subnets needed
    - Number of hosts allowed on each subnet
    - subnet mask is used to divide network into subnets

### Subnetted Addresses

- Divide address's host portion to 2 parts, host -> subnet + host
- Host bits borrowed to become subnet. No. of bits to be borrowed is dependant on on of subnets to be created

### Creating Subnets

- Subnet mask is modified net mask that extends into host portion of address
- subnet mask to determine which bits from address's host portion define subnet
- subnet portion becomes part of subnetted network address portion

### Establish Subnet Information

- No of borrowed bits dependent on **no of subnets required** and **max no of hosts per subnet**
- Formula to find *no of host bits to borrow* is
  - No of required subnets < = $2^{subnet bits}$ - 2
- Formula to find *no of usable hosts per subnet* is
  - Usable hosts per subnet = $2^h$ - 2
    - h = remaining host bits

## IP Broadcast Address

### Limited Broadcast

- Packet sent to IP 255.255.255.255 is *limited broadcast* packet
- Should never pass through router, only through MAC layer bridges

### Directed Broadcast

- Packet sent to destination IP address where only host portion of IP address is all 1 is *directed broadcast* packet
- May pass through router and will be broadcast to all hosts on network
- Can be network-directed or subnetwork-directed

## Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)

### Problems with Class-Based Addressing

- Address allocation is difficult - does not match real needs
  - Class A - too few to give out
  - Class C - 1 address block too small for most sites
    - Multiple class C blocks make routing table too big
  - Class B - what everyone wants but running out
- Classful system of allocating IP addresses is wasteful
  - Anyone who needs more than 254 hosts are given class B - **65533 host addresses!**

### Classless

- Eliminates traditional concept of class A, B, C, and enables efficient allocation of IP address - assigned address based on needs
- Developed to overcome exhaustion of class B address space and explosion of routing between many Class C addresses
- Allows companies to allocated exact number of networks they need.

### Address Notation

- Rules of class **do not** apply
- Network numbers according to class are no longer valid
- Move from class to prefix
- CIDR notation
  - specify mask associated with address by appending slash and size of mask in decimal
  - instead of being limited to network identifiers, CIDR uses varying network prefixes from 13 to 30 bits

### IP Prefix

- represent subnet mask as prefix rather than mask
- prefix represents no of network / subnet bits

# Chapter 7 - Virtual Lan

## VLANs and Broadcast Domains

Switch can put some interfaces into 1 Broadcast domain(**LAN**) and some into another, creating multiple broadcast domains

1 switch, multiple broadcast domains

## LAN vs VLAN

VLANS

- Control network broadcast without routers
- Allow Users to be assigned by network admin
- Provide tighter network security by defining which node can communicate with each other

## VLAN Membership

VLANs are formed using switches that support VLAN

- Users are grouped logically by function, department, or application in use
- Configuration through Software
- Membership defined by network admin

## Create VLANs

### Static VLAN

Ports on a switch are manually assigned to a VLAN

Benefits

- Secure, easy to configure and monitor
- Works well in networks where moves are configured

### Dynamic VLAN

- Switch ports can automatically determine a users VLAN based on
  - MAC
  - Logical Address
  - Prototype Type
- Move host from 1 port on 1 switch to a port on another switch in the same network, the switch dynamically assigns the new port to the proper VLAN for the host

Benefits

- Less administration when users are added or moved
- Centralized notification of unauthorized user

## Grouping User

- Logically segment users into different subnets
- Broadcast frames are only switched between ports on the switch with the same VLAN ID
- Ussers can be logically grouped vis *Software* based on
  - port no
  - MAC addres
  - Network protocol used
  - Application being used

### Port-Based (Layer 1)

- Groups switch ports.
- Can group together ports from different switches
- Does not allow mobility
- Need to reconfigure VLAN membership each time user moves from 1 port to another

### MAC-Address (Layer 2)

- Defined by list of MAC addresses
- Group by MAC Address
- User Mobility
- Client & server always on same VLAN regardless of location
- Problem
  - Too many addresses need to be entered and managed in VLAN Management Policy Server
  - Performance Degradatin

### Network Protocol Based (Layer 3)

- Take into consideration of Layer 3 protocol type
  - E.g. IP (Type 0x80)
- Known as virtual subnet
- inspects packet's IP to determine VLAN membership
- Stations do not belong to VLAN, packets do
- User mobility
- Problem
  - Slow Performance due to inspection of packet

### Application

- Different VLAN for different application services
  - E.g. FTP --> VLAN 1, SSH --> VLAN2
- Service based VLANs
  - All workstations using e-mail server are on email VLAN
- Need high level of automated configuration features

## VLAN across the backbone

- VLAN config needs to support backbone(*trunk*) transport of data cross multiple switches
- Trunk is used for inter switch communication
- Trunk should be high speed links - 1000 Mbps or greater

## Frame Tagging

- Specified by IEEE 802.1Q stating frame tagging is preferred way to implement VLAN
- Assigns VLAN ID to each frame before forwarded across backbone
- Places a tag in the frame and thus, frame tagging
- Removed by switch after frame exits backbone

### Tag

- Mofified Ethernet II frmae by adding 4 byte tag between source MAC address & Type field
- First 2 of the 4 Bytes contain 8100(Hex) to indicate a tag frame. (TAG protocol ID)
- Last 2 bytes contain the Tag Control Information
  - Priority Code Point PCP, (3 bits) - Indicate priority of frame
  - Canonical Format Indicator, CFI (1 bit) - 1 = Cannot be sent to ethernet ports that do not support tagging
  - VLAN identifier, VID (12 bits) - 0 = does not belong to any VLAN, FFF is reserved, 4094 numbers for VLAN

## Routers role in VLAN

- Router provides connection between VLANs
- Users on seperate VLANs cannot communicate with one another
- Router is needed for communication

## Layer 3 switch

- Layer 2 switch that can perform routing functions

## Reasons for VLAN

- Control broadcasts
  - Routers provide effective firewall against broadcasts
  - VLAN can extend routers firewall capabilities to the switch level
  - Smaller VLAN = smaller no of users affected by broadcasts
- Allow flexible design
  - Allow flexible designs that group users by department or by groups that work together, instead of by physical location
- Make changes easier
  - Travelling Users
    - 20%-40% of work force moves every year
    - VLANs provide way to control costs
    - If user moved to new location but still need to belong to same VLAN
      - Configure new switch port to the VLAN
      - router config remains intact
- Improves security
  - Confining broadcast to users in same VLAN
  - Restricting no of users in VLAN
  - Prevent user access without authorization
  - Control access by
    - addresses
    - protocol types
    - application types
